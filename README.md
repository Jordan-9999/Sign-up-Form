# Sign-up-Form

This is a sign up form for an imaginary service that I made for the Odin Project course using HTML and CSS.

It was a good opportunity to get some experience building a form and using CSS.

Here is a link to the Sign-up form project lesson that I was following:

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project. -Jordan Sheeler
